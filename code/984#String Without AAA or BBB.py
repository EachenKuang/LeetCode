"""
Given two integers A and B, return any string S such that:

S has length A + B and contains exactly A 'a' letters, and exactly B 'b' letters;
The substring 'aaa' does not occur in S;
The substring 'bbb' does not occur in S.


Example 1:

Input: A = 1, B = 2
Output: "abb"
Explanation: "abb", "bab" and "bba" are all correct answers.
Example 2:

Input: A = 4, B = 1
Output: "aabaa"


Note:

0 <= A <= 100
0 <= B <= 100
It is guaranteed such an S exists for the given A and B.
