Today I find that some problems are not good that many people are against them.

These problems are always getting more opposite thumbs.

So I decided to ignore those problems with more opposite thumbsã€‚

Such as 475#Heaters

With the speed, maybe I can finish all the easy problems before Spring Festival!
